# CSE373-Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm
I've taken this course under Sifat Momen,PhD (Assistant Professor at NSU) in Spring 2019.

## Code and Name	CSE 373 Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Type	Core
## Credit Hours	3
## Pre-requisites	
CSE 225 – Data Structure and Algorithms, MAT 361 – Probability and Statistics
## Course Summary: 
This course introduces basic methods for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms emphasizing methods useful in practice. Different algorithms for a given computational task are presented and their relative merits evaluated based on performance measures. The following important computational problems will be discussed: sorting, searching, elements of divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms, advanced data structures, graph algorithms (shortest path, spanning trees, tree traversals), string matching, NP completeness.

## Course Objectives: The objectives of this course are to

1. analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms.
2. write rigorous correctness proofs for algorithms.
3. demonstrate a familiarity with major algorithms and data structures.
4. apply important algorithmic design paradigms and methods of analysis.
5. synthesize efficient algorithms in common engineering design situations.
